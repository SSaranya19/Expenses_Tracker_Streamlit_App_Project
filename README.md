# Analyzing Personal Expenses

This project simulates an individualâ€™s expense tracker using the Faker library. It generates realistic monthly expenses, stores them in a SQL database, and runs queries to analyze spending behavior. A Streamlit app is built to visualize insights and display results from these queries. The tracker covers categories like bills, groceries, subscriptions, and personal spending, offering a full view of financial habits over a year.
